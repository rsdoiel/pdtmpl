pdtmpl
======

A light weight pre-processor for Pandoc. Target use case is JSON object
documents rendered via Pandoc templates.

This is a proof-of-concept Go package which makes it easy to extend
your Go application to incorporate Pandoc template processing. It includes
the Go package and an example command line tool (cli).

The command line implementation is a proof of concept Pandoc
pre-processor in Go. An example usage would be to process
[example.json](example.json) JSON document using a Pandoc template
called [example.tpml](example.tmpl).

```shell
    pdtmpl example.tmpl -t html5 < example.json > example.html
```

Go package
----------

Here's some simple use examples of the three functions supplied
in the pdtmpl package.

Given a JSON Object document  as a slice of bytes render formated
output based on the Pandoc template `example.tmpl`

```go
    src, err := ioutil.ReadFile("example.json")
    if err != nil {
        // ... handle error
    }
    // options passed to Pandoc
    opt := []string{"-t", "html5"}
    src, err = pdtmpl.Format(src, "example.tmpl", opt)
    if err != nil {
        // ... handle error
    }
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "%s", src)
```

Using an `io.Reader` to retrieve the JSON content, process with the
`example.tmpl` template and write standard output

```go
    f, err := Open("example.json")
    if err != nil {
        // ... handle error
    }
    defer f.Close()
    // options passed to Pandoc
    opt := []string{"-t", "html5"}
    src, err := pdtmpl.ReadAll(f, "example.tmpl", opt)
    if err != nil {
        // ... handle error
    }
    fmt.Fprintf(os.Stdout, "%s", src)
```

Using an `io.Reader` and `io.Writer` to read JSON source from standard
input and write the processed pandoc templated standard output.

```go
    // options passed to Pandoc
    opt := []string{"-t", "html5"}
    err := pdtmpl.ApplyTemplate(os.Stdin, os.Stdout, "example.tmpl", opt)
    if err != nil {
        // ... handle error
    }
```
